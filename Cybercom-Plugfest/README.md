## 1. About

OpenC2 is a recently released suite of OASIS specifications that define a standard language for command and control of cyber defense technologies.
The [OpenC2 Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2) (TC) 
is running a plug fest / hackathon on 27-28 January 2020, sponsored by US Cyber Command 
and hosted in the nearby [UMBC Training](https://umbctraining.com/) facility in Columbia, MD.
The Plug Fest is open to interested participants, regardless of whether they are OASIS members. 
The UMBC facility and the Plug Fest are unclassified, and there is no restriction to U.S. organizations or individuals.

Further details and registration information can be found at DreamPort: https://dreamport.tech/event-open-c2-plug-fest-01272820.php

for the UBMC Training facility

Integrate once, reuse everywhere.
Stop having to know the
syntax of each different product that’s involved in
today’s complex, multivendor, security operations environment.
OpenC2 commoditizes the command and control (C2)
allowing security teams to automate an orchestrated response
more efficiently, as well as avoiding vendor lock-in.

A goal of the Plug Fest is to execute use cases using OpenC2 and gather lessons learned about interoperability.
The plugfest aspect is for testing interworking of existing OpenC2 implementations. Let us know what you have and we will work your implementation into the test plans.
The hackathon aspect is for improving the interworking of existing OpenC2 implementations,  extending existing implementations (e.g., the many OpenC2 open source projects), and/or creating new implementations of OpenC2.

The plugfest is not a meeting of the OASIS OpenC2 Technical Commmittee. It does not count towards voting rights for members of the OpenC2 TC. No work will be done on the OpenC2 specifications themselves
although OpenC2 members are welcome to bring inspirations or suggestions from the plugfest to the TC.

## 2. Is it Plugfest or Hackathon? BOTH!
It is both a plugfest (testing interoperability of existing implementations)
and a hackathon (writing software to meet a need).
Come prepared to participate in either or both.

## 3. Who is attending?
Although it is not required to announce if you will be attending,
the hope is many will and include what they will be bringing to the table:
- AT&T
- Broadcom/Symantec
- DoD - Active Cyber Defense of Critical Infastructure (ACDCI)

## 4. What use cases are addressed?
It is not required, but hoped, that attendees will publish use cases of interest
prior to arriving.
One of the first orders of business will be a brainstorming session
to make this list as complete as possible for meeting the attendees needs.
Immediately following will be scheduling out what to work on during the two days.

### 4.1 DoD Comply to Connect
The DoD CIO and the Chief of CYBERCOM have been tasked (Public Law 114-328-DEC. 23, 2016 Sec 1653) with creating a ‘comply to connect’ policy for all DoD networked devices. They consider a software inventory (termed a Software Bill of Materials or SBOM in many industries. See http://ntia.gov/sbom) an integral part of ‘comply to connect’ since you can’t claim compliance if you don’t know what software is present.
The use case continues with various actions to be taken based on analyzing the SBoM.
See [here](uc-A-comply-to-connect.md) for more info.

### 4.2 Fill-in-the-blank Comply to Connect
"Fill-in-the-blank comply to connect" is a set of usecases for other industries that have similar needs to the DoD use case above. The differences will be in the policy in what the 'acceptance' criteria are and what actions will be taken. The common aspect is a request for a SBoM. In some cases the acceptance criteria may be simply that one exists. In another it may be that it is complete and no known CVE's with CVSS>7 are present. Etc. The DoD use case has a set of actions to be taken that other usecases may use a subset of, or may have unique actions of it's own.

One area that where comply-to-connect has been receiving more attention is healthcare.
Wannacry caused serious hospital outages in the UK.
Even thought the health impact was less in the US, there was still significant
resources expended in determining whether it would be an impact.
In another healhcare area, the US FDA has given pre-market guidance (govspeak for "do this or we won't approve you") to medical device makers that SBoMs are required.
OpenC2 offers one mechanism to retrieve the SBoM for use in either of these cases (vulnerability assessment ala Wannacry or regulatory compliance ala FDA).

Supply chain transparency for software is also receiving increased attention in both automotive and pubic transport.

include ISP/CSP scenario

include sFractal home/small-business scenarios

### 4.3 sFractal IoT Single Packet Authentication
See [here](uc-sFractal-IoT-SPA.md) for the Single Packet Authentication usecase proposed by sFractal.

### 4.4 Firewall Configuration and Management

- University of Oslo: The use case of UiO includes a prototype implementation of the OASIS OpenC2 SLPF version 1.0 with the purpose of controling Access Control Lists (firewall capability) in Cisco devices (e.g., routers, L3 switches, firewalls). In their use case a Cisco Cloud Service Router (CSR1000V with Cisco IOS XE Software, Version 16.12.01a) in the Google Cloud Platform is controlled. The use case is available [HERE](https://github.com/Vasileios-Mavroeidis/openc2-plugfest/tree/master/2020-January). The PoC is available [HERE](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-iosacl-adapter). In their use case, an idea of how to enable coordinated response via OpenC2 is presented, even though it is out of OpenC2 scope (at this moment).

## 5. OASIS OpenC2 TC relationship to Plugfest/Hackathon
The OpenC2 plugfest/hackathon is open to all interested participants whether OASIS members or not, and therefore is NOT a meeting of the Technical Committee itself. The OASIS rules governing TC meetings, including provisions of the OASIS IPR policy, do not apply and any outputs from the event are not 'contributions' as defined in OASIS rules. Members of the TC who wish to formally contribute any outputs from the event to the TC must (as with any contribution) be sure that they have sufficient rights in the material to do so.

OASIS and the OpenC2 TC welcome participation by all interested parties. Participants who are not OASIS members but are interested in joining in the work being done by the TC are welcome to contact the event chairs for information on the opportunities available.

### 6.1 OpenC2 Plugfest Planning

As discussed at the 18 September TC meeting OpenC2 has been offered the opportunity to run a plug fest hosted
by US Cyber Command in their public, unclassified DreamPort facility. TC members are encouraged to consider
participation in this event, tentatively planned for the week of 27 January 2020.

TC chair's initial request (19 Sept) for plug fest participation:

### 6.2 Lessons Learned from Previous Plugfests
The CTI TC published lessons learned from their STIX plugfest, which
included:

**Issue:** Lack of stable/validated schema and data sets that can be used for all clients and servers

**Action:**
* Define and maintain a package of downloadable JSON schema and test data that all plugfest/interop participants can use before plugfest. These are available in the [Schemas](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-usecases/tree/master/Cybercom-Plugfest/Schemas) folder.
* Need common sets of data for all to use for testing.  These are available in the [TestData](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-usecases/tree/master/Cybercom-Plugfest/TestData) folder.
* Need sets of data that are unique to vendors or use cases that help provide more robust testing.

This repository includes use case descriptions, schemas, and test data (good and bad) for use by participants prior to the event.

### 6.3 About The Facility

The UMBC Training facility we'll be using has allocated us two rooms, 
each of which can accommodate 30-35ish people. We'll have tables & chairs, 
white boards, flip-chart easels, and wireless and wired network connections 
with Internet access to support our efforts. We are arranging 10-12 monitors 
to assign to tables for display purposes (but you can also bring one if you wish).

The facility has a nice break room with beverages and snacks (and pretty good coffee). 
There is plenty of (free) parking. Note that the facility entrance is on the side 
away from Columbia Gateway Drive, facing inward toward the shared parking lot. 
And there are plenty of restaurants nearby for lunch. 

### 6.4 FAQ
- Will WiFi be provided? More than one SSID? What networking details?
  * The UMBC facility provides a single WiFi network that will be readily
  accessible to plug fest participants.
- Will wired ethernet be provided? More than one network? What networking details?
  * The UMBC facility is providing wired Ethernet drops and switches for each of the two
  rooms allocated for our event. The WiFi and the wired Ethernet are all on the same LAN.
- DHCP or Static IP or choice-of-either? Will IP addresses (or at least ranges) be available prior to arriving to allow preconfiguration (eg only allow access from these ranges)
  * UMBC is mapping public ports to static LAN IPs sufficient to connect to 20 devices on ports 80 and 443.
- IPV4? IPV6?
  * IPv4 has been tested.  If anyone actually requires IPv6 please speak up and we'll see if it's available.
- Will our devices be able to reach the internet? Will IPs/ports need to be prearranged to get thru firewalls?
  * The facility freely permits outbound traffic to Internet sites, and this has been tested by NSA OpenC2 team.
  No special prearrangements are required.
- Will our devices be reachable from the internet? Will IPs/ports need to be prearranged to get thru firewalls?
  * See above; support for 20 devices has been arranged. More can be added if there is demand.
- Will whiteboards be provided?
  * One room has "whiteboard walls", the other room has some whiteboards; there are also flip-chart easels.
- Will projector be provided?
  * There is a project and screen in one room; the NSA OpenC2 team is also arranging for a monitor per
  work table for display purposes.
- Will certificates be needed for interworking (e.g., for HTTPS mutual authentication)? If so - how arrange?
  * Nothing has been arranged to supply certificates at this time.
